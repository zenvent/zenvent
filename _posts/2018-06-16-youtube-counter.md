I designed a YouTube subscriber counter for the ESP8266. It drives a 4-digit 7 segment display and updates regularly (over wifi).
The TV case was designed in [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) then exported as STL. It can be 3D printed in two halves and glued together.
The 'screen' is simply acrylic with metallic spray paint on the back- this gives the effect of static noise and is also semi-transparent to allow the LED lights through.
