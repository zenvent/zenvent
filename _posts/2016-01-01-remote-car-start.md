I figured out a way to cheaply start my car using a text message. I wanted to be able to do this because my office is quite the distance from where I park, and my current remote starter has a range of only 20 feet or so. Learn how to do this yourself by click the link below or watching my video tutorial.

## Objective

Extend the range of my vehicle's auto-start using the cheapest solution I can think of. I would also like to keep vehicle modifications to a minimum (or none).

## Solution

Trigger the auto-start remote using an Arduino connected to a cell service. User will send an SMS message to the device, which will validate the message then trigger a relay which will cause the remote to send a signal and the car will start. The device will be left in the car and run off the vehicle's battery.

## Skills required

If you follow the tutorial, basic computer and electronics skills. I am assuming you can make connections using a bread board or soldering iron. I am also assuming your car already has a remote starter installed, and that you are willing to sacrifice one of the remotes.

## Required Materials

* [Arduino Uno $15](https://amzn.to/4alIFsw)
* [Relay Module $6](https://amzn.to/4boyHIi)
* [GPRS Shield $10](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=Seeed+gprs+Shield+for+Arduino&_sacat=0)
* [SIM Card: Ting](https://ting.com/rates)
* [Breadboard & Wires (or solder)](https://amzn.to/3V3o73w)
* Car Start Remote Control

*This tutorial assumes you already have remote start on your car*

## Estimated Cost

Materials:  $45

SIM & Service:  $10 SIM Card + $6 monthly
