I created a model in fusion 360 that is fully parameterized.

I did this mainly for testing different settings easily, but in the end I wanted to generate multiple varients of the 'self-watering' planter to sell. I needed a way to quickly export the all the models, in all possible sizes. In this case I wrote a script that iterates through the existing bodies in a project, exports them as stl, then applys a parameter update and repeats. It even skips parts that are constant. See the code for more details.

Once I've generated all the stl files, I loaded them into one Bambu Studio project (or Orca Slicer etc). Now I can easilly check the box of the compoents I want and print, and all settings will carry over to each part as ordered.
